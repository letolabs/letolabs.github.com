Leto Labs LLC specializes in researching, developing and deploying
Free/Libre/Open Source (FLOSS) Software Solutions across various disciplines
including automation, version control, scientific computing, visualization,
databases and data analysis, simulation and even those quaint devices known
as websites. Leto strives to be a research lab that doesn't need a larger organization
around
first and a company second. We hack on cool stuff that changes the world.

</p>

<p>
The philosophy of Leto Labs LLC is that building reusable and accessible
components benefits everyone. Instead of writing 100 lines of proprietary code
that will never see the light of day, one can almost always write 80 lines of
code that is reusable and then another 20-30 lines of code that specializes
that reusable component for a specific situation. Accessible code is code that
is easy to download and install. You can find the code contributions from us
on <a href="https://github.com/letolabs">Github</a>.
