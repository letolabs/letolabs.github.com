Any company large enough to have a research lab is too large to listen to it.

<p>

Leto Labs LLC is a new kind of research lab. We fund ourselves, so we don't have
to worry about being ignored or constrained by those that do.
</p>

<h2> New!: <a href="http://littlecf.github.com">The Little Cloud Foundry Book</a></h2>

<p>

Leto Labs LLC specializes in researching, developing and deploying
Free/Libre/Open Source (FLOSS) Software Solutions across various disciplines
including automation, version control, scientific computing, visualization,
databases and data analysis, simulation and even those quaint devices known
as websites.
</p>

<p>

We hack on stuff that changes the world. What else would you want to spend your time on?

</p>

<p>
The philosophy of Leto Labs LLC is that building reusable and accessible
components benefits everyone. Instead of writing 100 lines of proprietary code
that will never see the light of day, one can almost always write 80 lines of
code that is reusable and then another 20-30 lines of code that specializes
that reusable component for a specific situation. Accessible code is code that
is easy to download and install. Grab our code
on <a href="https://github.com/letolabs">Github</a> and check our <a href="/blog/">blog</a> for updates.
