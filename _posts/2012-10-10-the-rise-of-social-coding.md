# {{ page.title }}

I will be talking about "The Rise of Social Coding" at the [Social Media User
Group](http://www.socialmediausersgroup.org/). It will be held at the awesome
[Collective Agency](http://collectiveagency.co/) on October 24th from 6-8pm.

Talking points:

* Where did social coding come from?
* Where is social coding right now?
* Where will social coding take us in the future?
* How is social coding changing the way developers work?
* Are resumes obsolete in a world of social coding?
