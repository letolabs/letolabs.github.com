I will be talking about "The Rise of Social Coding" at the [Social Media User
Group](http://www.socialmediausersgroup.org/). It will be held at the awesome
[Collective Agency](http://collectiveagency.co/) on October 24th from 6-8pm.

Some talking points that I will cover:

* Where did social coding come from?
* Where is social coding right now?
* Where will social coding take us in the future?
* How is social coding changing the way developers work?
* Are resumes obsolete in a world of social coding?

Social coding is much older than most people think. Nobody knows any exact
dates, but it most probably started with
[sneakernets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) in the 1960's and
1970's. Back in the old days when dinosaurs might eat your "console", the only way
to share code was to copy files, modify them, and then pass them around on
physical media.

A defining moment in the history of social coding is when the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)">patch</a> program was written
by [Larry Wall](http://www.wall.org/~larry/) (of [Perl](http://perl.org) fame) in May of 1985.
There were surely other kinds of patching software before this (patches go all
the way back to punch cards) but the ```patch``` program was the first Free +
Open source software to accomplish this and formed the basis of most version
control systems that evolved soon after it. Finally you could just pass around
the part of the code that changed instead of whole files or whole codebases!
This was huge when floppies reigned and megabytes were magically large
quantities.

Fast-forward to now and we have [Github](https://github.com),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), pull requests with in-line comments and
snazzy web interfaces for social coding. Where are we going next?  Come join us
at the Social Media User Group and find out!
