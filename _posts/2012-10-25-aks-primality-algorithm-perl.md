# {{ page.title }}

The first implementaiton of the
[AKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test) (Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena)
primality algorithm in pure Perl!

[Math::Primality::AKS](https://metacpan.org/module/Math::Primality::AKS)

The majority of the work was done by my previous GSoC student, Bob Kuo. I
merely helped get the fix_aks branch merged, helped add some tests and pushed
the distribution to CPAN.
