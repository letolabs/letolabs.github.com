# {{ page.title }}

Paul Erdős was the most prolific mathematician the world has ever seen.

Ingy is a modern Erdős who leaves a wake of code in whichever language he
touches.

Explain Erdős numbers. Just like kevin bacon degrees of seperation.

$$ I_{e} = \left< n_e, n_i\right> $$

$$ d(I_e) = \sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = \sqrt(17) \sim 4.12 $$

I have an Erdős number of three, because Peter J. Cameron published a paper
with Erdos in 1990, who later published a paper with John Cannon, who was a
co-author on a paper I published in 2002 as an undergraduate research assistant
at University of Central Florida.
