<a href="https://github.com/letolabs/freeyourself">Free Your Self</a> is an easy way to take donations as a free/open source
developer. It uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and is designed to be installed and
configured as a website hosted on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. That makes it the easiest to use, but
if you would like to run it on your own server, that is possible too.

You define all the details for methods of donations that you support in your
<a href="https://github.com/letolabs/freeyourself/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml">_config.yml file</a>. 
Then Free Your Self renders all the donation buttons that are
configured. Currently, FYS supports <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a>,
<a href="http://dwolla.com">Dwolla</a>, <a href="http://paypal.com">Paypal</a>, and 
<a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a> .
Amazon Payments and Google Checkout support is on the way. If you would like to accept
other forms of donations, let us know!

Our philosophy is: The more ways there are to donate to you, the more likely
you are to get donations.
