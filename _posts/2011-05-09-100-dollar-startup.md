# {{ page.title }}

I have been following the writing of Chris Guillebeau for a long time.

"The $100 Startup" is an exciting book because it cuts through the crap of
"talking about" things and go straight into how you can actually "do those
things."

This is done by profiling many different "accidental entrepeneurs" and studying
what made them choose the path they are on and what they had to do to be
successful.

On one hand, it is not surprising that many of the businesses in the book are
in Portland, Oregon, since Chris lives in Portland. But that makes you think:
Chris has traveled to just about every country in the world: Why did he choose
Portland as home? Perhaps it is the Shangri-La for accidental entrepeneurs.
Portlandia would like you to think that it is the land of twenty-something
retirees, but that doesn't quite explain the existince of the Silicon Forest.
