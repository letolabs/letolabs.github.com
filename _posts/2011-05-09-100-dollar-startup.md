# {{ page.title }}

I have been following the writing of Chris Guillebeau for a long time.

"The $100 Startup" is an exciting book because it cuts through the crap of
"talking about" things and go straight into how you can actually "do those
things."

This is done by profiling many different "accidental entrepeneurs" and studying
what made them choose the path they are on and what they had to do to be
successful.

On one hand, it is not surprising that many of the businesses in the book are
in Portland, Oregon, since Chris lives in Portland. But that makes you think:
Chris has traveled to just about every country in the world: Why did he choose
Portland as home? Perhaps it is the Shangri-La for accidental entrepeneurs.
Portlandia would like you to think that it is the land of twenty-something
retirees, but that doesn't quite explain the existince of the Silicon Forest 
or the menagerie of non-tech startups that Chris details in the book.

## Free + Open $100 Startups

This book is specifically not focused on tech and other startups that require
very specific knowledge in a particular niche. That is good, because all the
examples in the book make you think "Wow, I could have come up with that".

## Not Just A Story

One of the most valuable parts of the book, for myself, was the frequent
checklists and excerpts to the main text, such as ["The One Page Business Plan"](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf),
["Thirty-Nine-Step Product Launch Checklist"](http://100startup.com/resources/launch-checklist.pdf), ["The One Page Promotion Plan"](http://100startup.com/resources/promotion-plan.pdf) and
many others. In addition to these, there is an appendix containing a list of 25
selected case studies of \$100 Startups, which includes the name of the primary
founder, name of the business, a fact-based description and the emotion-based
promise of the business. This is an invaluable resource for studying the people
and businesses that a would-be \$100 Startup entrepeneur can emulate.
