We lost one of the hubs of the Portland tech community yesterday, when Igal
Koshevoy took his own life.

"How could we have prevented this?" was one of the first thoughts to race through
my mind when I heard the news. I had not pushed a Github commit in 5 months and
hadn't posted his beloved photos to Flickr in almost a year.
